Why TypeScript:

- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript
- TypeScript is a statically typed language
- TypeScript is a strongly typed language
- TypeScript is a compiled language
- TypeScript is an object-oriented language

- Developer productivity - TypeScript is a statically typed language, which means that you can catch errors and bugs at compile time rather than at runtime. This can help you catch bugs early in the development process, which can save you time and effort in the long run.

- Code maintainability - TypeScript is a strongly typed language, which means that you can define the types of variables, functions, and other elements in your code. This can make your code easier to read and understand, and can help you avoid common programming errors.

- Code scalability - TypeScript is a compiled language, which means that you can write your code in TypeScript and then compile it down to JavaScript. This can help you write more complex and scalable applications, and can help you avoid some of the pitfalls of writing large applications in JavaScript.

- Job opportunities - TypeScript is becoming increasingly popular in the software development industry, and many companies are looking for developers who have experience with TypeScript. Learning TypeScript can help you stand out from other job candidates and can help you land a job at a top tech company.

<!-- Errors fixed: Runtime error, Syntax error, Logical error, Semantic error, Type error, Range error, Reference error, URI error, Eval error, Internal error, etc. -->
